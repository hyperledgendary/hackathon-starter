## Step 3: Plan your project

Do you have a domain in mind? Supply chain for example, or financial asset transfer? 
It is important to have a domain and scenario in mind, most scenarions are asset based in some way hence the starter applications are based around assets. 

Within the solution, there will be contracts and applications.  There are basic examples of both of these within this repo and in different langauges. The basic examples are designed to work with each other.

## Step 4: Tutorials

Here are some suggested tutorials to start to understand what you can do. 

- Within the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension there are some starter tutorials; worth doing these as they show you how the extension can help you develop.
